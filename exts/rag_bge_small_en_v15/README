Background workers must be initialized in the extension's `_PG_init()` function and can only be started if loaded through the `shared_preload_libraries` configuration setting. So to use this extension you'll need to edit `postgresql.conf` and, depending on the platform, add:

```
shared_preload_libraries = 'rag_bge_small_en_v15.so'
```

or

 ```
shared_preload_libraries = 'rag_bge_small_en_v15.dylib'
```
