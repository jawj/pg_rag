## ORT patch

The `ort` and `ort-sys` packages are drawn from a local source because (as at 2024-09-06) otherwise we end up with `ort` 2.0.0-rc.4 and `ort-sys` 2.0.0-rc.5, and this causes an ONNX runtime version mismatch.


## Cache location

The fastembed-rs cache (for any models downloaded dynamically, which currently none are) is at: `~/.pgrx/data-13/.fastembed_cache/`.


## Names
